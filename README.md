# mircade: Example Confined Desktop Environment

## An example project

A few games bundled in a confined desktop environment.

This is intended primarily as an exemplar for developers showing how selected apps might be managed in a confined environment.

It example takes a slightly modified version of egmde (https://github.com/AlanGriffiths/egmde) and
uses it to launch applications from a bundled collection (in this case of games).
